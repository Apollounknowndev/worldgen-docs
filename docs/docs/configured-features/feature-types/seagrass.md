## Seagrass

<head>
    {% include field-type-colors.html %}
</head>

The `minecraft:seagrass` feature type is used to place a single seagrass. In vanilla, this is used in the Ocean and River biomes.

{: .position }
> The placement position of this feature is moved to the height of the `OCEAN_FLOOR` heightmap.
>
> The change in position of where the seagrass is placed on the x and z coordinates relative to the starting point functions identically to an `xz_spread` of 7 with the `minecraft:random_patch` feature type.
